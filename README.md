It's worth noting that py2app may not be compatible with Python 3.11.1 yet, as it was only recently released in October 2021 and py2app may not have been updated to support it yet.

However, you can try using an alternative tool called pyinstaller to build your Mac OS app from a Python script. Pyinstaller is a Python library that also converts Python scripts into standalone applications for various platforms including Mac OS.

Here are the steps to create an app using pyinstaller:

Install pyinstaller: You can install pyinstaller using pip. Open a terminal and type the following command:

```pip install pyinstaller```

Build the app: To build the app, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. Then type the following command:
css

```pyinstaller --onefile my_script.py```

Replace 'my_script.py' with the name of your Python script. The --onefile option specifies that you want to create a single executable file for your app.

Locate the app: Once the build process is complete, you will find a 'dist' folder in the same directory as your Python script. Inside the 'dist' folder, you will find the app file.

That's it! You have successfully created a Mac OS app from your Python script using pyinstaller.
